# Pixel-Art-Maker V.01
###### An app created for Udacity's FrontEnd Development Scholarship challenge final project

### About
This is a web app for creating pixel art. This project uses jQuery.

### Usage
- Enter any value from 1 to 50 into the input fields with label **Height** and **Width** and then click on the **Create artboard** button
  - This creates a grid making the space ready to start creating
  - The cell size in a grid maybe large or small depending on the size entered while creating the artboard
- The **Toolbox** can be found on the left side of the grid
- Hovering over each tool will show a tooltip of the action it performs
- Click on the tool and start using it on the grid

**_Note:_**
- There is no feature to save the created art as an image right now, but planning to implement it soon
- This app is only for desktop use
