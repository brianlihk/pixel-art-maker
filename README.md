# Pixel-Art-Maker V.2
###### An app created for Udacity's FrontEnd Development Scholarship challenge final project originally

### About
This is a web app for creating pixel art. This project uses jQuery.

### Usage
- A grid will be created initally making the space ready to start creating
- The cell size in a grid maybe large or small depending on the size entered while creating the artboard
- The **Toolbox** can be found on the left side of the grid
- Hovering over each tool will show a tooltip of the action it performs
- Click on the tool and start using it on the grid

**_Note:_**
- I added a feature to save the created art as an png image.
- This app is only for desktop use
